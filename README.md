## 🎯 Project Overview

This project applies Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques and Business Intelligence practices to extract insights from two datasets — one based on the RMS Titanic passenger data and the other on a retail coffee chain’s sales performance.  
Dashboards were created in Tableau to translate analytical findings into clear and interactive visual insights.
